# Methodology: Building the RSA Innovation Sandbox 2025 Company Reports and Executive Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the methodology used to create the individual company reports for each RSA Innovation Sandbox 2025 finalist and the consolidated executive summary report for executive partners and resellers.

## 1. Data Collection
- **Primary Sources:** Official company websites, press releases, product documentation, and leadership bios were reviewed for each finalist.
- **Secondary Sources:** Industry analysis (e.g., Forrester, Futurum Group), news articles, and RSA Conference materials were used to validate and supplement company-provided information.
- **Direct Citations:** Where possible, all factual claims were supported by direct citations, with URLs and publication dates included in the appendices of each report.

## 2. Report Structure
- **Standardized Template:** Each company report followed a consistent structure: Executive Summary, Company Overview, Product/Services, Addressing the Cybersecurity Challenge, Solution Approach, Customer & Traction, Go-To-Market Strategy, Management & Leadership, Financial Information, and Appendix.
- **Key Metrics:** Where available, customer names, funding amounts, revenue, and deployment status were included to provide objective measures of traction and credibility.
- **Balanced Analysis:** Reports included both strengths (differentiators, customer validation) and challenges (market risks, competitive landscape) for a fair and actionable assessment.

## 3. Synthesis and Validation
- **Cross-Verification:** Information was cross-checked across multiple sources to ensure accuracy and resolve discrepancies (e.g., funding totals, leadership changes).
- **Analyst Insights:** Industry analyst commentary was incorporated to provide context on market trends and the significance of each companyâ€™s approach.
- **Direct Quotes:** Where available, direct quotes from company executives or customers were included to add credibility and perspective.

## 4. Executive Summary Construction
- **Selection and Ordering:** The summary report highlighted ProjectDiscovery as the winner and CalypsoAI as the runner-up, with remaining companies listed alphabetically for clarity.
- **Conciseness:** Each company was summarized in a single page, focusing on the most relevant information for executive decision-makers.
- **Audience Alignment:** The summary was tailored for executives and partners interested in reselling or integrating innovative cybersecurity solutions, emphasizing partner opportunities and next steps.

## 5. Review and Quality Control
- **Consistency Checks:** All reports were reviewed for consistency in tone, structure, and level of detail.
- **Page Limit:** The final summary was designed to fit within an 11-page limit, ensuring brevity and focus.
- **Final Review:** The consolidated report was proofread for clarity, accuracy, and executive readability before distribution.
