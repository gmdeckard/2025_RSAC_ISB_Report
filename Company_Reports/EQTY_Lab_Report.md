## 3. Product/Services

Primary Product(s)/Service(s): AI Integrity Suite - a comprehensive platform that applies cryptography to ensure that the governance of AI agents is accountable and verifiable, establishing trust to allow them to run safely and at scale. [1][8]

The AI Integrity Suite comprises several integrated products:

1. **AI Guardian**: Announced at RSA Conference 2025, scheduled for general availability in Q3 2025. AI Guardian secures and aligns autonomous AI agents at runtime through cryptographic attestations that serve as persistent evidence of compliance across an agent's lifecycle. [1][5][9]

2. **Governance Studio**: Automates compliance and reporting with confidence by creating and deploying binding policies to automate compliance, streamlining risk assessment with AI-powered agents. [1][8]

3. **Lineage Explorer**: Visualizes and simplifies complex development pipelines, maintaining and auditing AI agents, models, and data in a simple interface. It provides actionable transparency across the AI supply chain. [1][8][10]

4. **AI Integrity Fabric**: Credentials all components and governance of AI, providing the foundation for the rest of the suite. It's rated SLSA Security Level 3 for security compliance. [1][8][9]

5. **Verifiable Compute**: Developed in partnership with Intel and NVIDIA, Verifiable Compute is a hardware-based solution that creates an immutable chain of trust for enterprise AI. It cryptographically signs every AI computation at runtime, providing an immutable certificate of authenticity. [1][11][12]

Key Features:
- Hardware-rooted cryptographic AI attestation
- Real-time compliance checks and enforcement
- On-silicon trust layer for AI operations
- Cryptographic certificate system for agent validation
- Tamper-proof records for auditing and compliance
- Portable agent credentials with verifiable integrity
- Runtime governance enforcement

Technology Stack: AI, Cryptography, Hardware-based Security (Intel TDX, NVIDIA Hopper), Blockchain/Distributed Ledger (Hedera integration)

## 4. Addressing the Cybersecurity Challenge

Identified Problem: Establishing trust in AI agents - ensuring AI agents can be trusted to operate safely and securely at scale as organizations increasingly deploy AI technologies across critical functions.

Market Size & Opportunity: As AI adoption grows across industries including public sector, life sciences, and finance, the need for trusted AI agents is expanding rapidly. EQTY Lab is positioned at the forefront of enabling AI innovation in these sectors [1][2].

## 5. Solution Approach

Core Technology & Innovation: EQTY Lab has developed an innovative approach to AI security and trust through what they call "Verifiable Compute" - a hardware-rooted cryptographic system that ensures the integrity of AI systems at every step of their lifecycle. The company's solution creates a "digital notary" that cryptographically signs all aspects of AI operations, from data ingestion to model training and inference, establishing an immutable chain of trust. [1][11][12]

Key Features and Functionality Explained:

1. **AI Guardian Operation Process**:
   - Analyze: Scans and discovers each agent's foundational components including models, tools, prompts, and configurations to establish a graph that determines alignment with security standards and business policies.
   - Remediate: Suggests tailored remediations and guardrails to maximize security and compliance, predicting problems that may occur due to drift, tool misuse, or behavioral deviations.
   - Certify: Cryptographically hashes the updated agent and governance actions to establish a certified baseline of compliance, with continuous verification at runtime. [1][9][12]

2. **Hardware-Rooted Security**:
   - Leverages Intel's Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) and NVIDIA's Hopper architecture to create a silicon-level security foundation.
   - Notarizes inputs, outputs, and work done on both CPU and GPU.
   - Binds governance at runtime to ensure AI systems operate as intended. [1][11][12]

3. **Cryptographic Compliance**:
   - Issues AI audit and lineage certificates that can be verified instantly or independently audited in the future.
   - Provides real-time compliance checks that integrate with regulations such as the EU AI Act.
   - Creates tamper-proof and portable records that extend trust across organizational boundaries. [1][8][12]

4. **Unified AI Security Platform**:
   - Provides comprehensive visibility through Lineage Explorer to visualize complex AI pipelines.
   - Offers policy creation and enforcement through Governance Studio.
   - Delivers continuous assurance across the entire AI lifecycle through the AI Integrity Fabric. [1][8]

Differentiation: Unlike traditional security approaches that focus on protecting individual components, EQTY Lab's solution establishes trust across the entire AI workflow by creating cryptographically verifiable records of compliance and operation. This approach addresses the unique challenges of AI systems, particularly autonomous agents that operate with minimal supervision across distributed environments. [1][9][11]

## 10. Appendix

According to the Forrester report, EQTY Lab is considered "game-changing" in addressing emerging problems related to AI trust. The company was noted as one of the top contenders in the 2025 RSA Innovation Sandbox competition and received votes from analysts during their predictions on who might win [3].

EQTY Lab is one of several finalists working on both using AI to improve security and securing AI itself. The company is focused on applying cryptography to manage AI agents, representing the growing importance of AI safety as an undisputable factor in security programs [4].

EQTY Lab's collaborative approach to developing Verifiable Compute, involving government agencies and major technology partners, demonstrates their commitment to creating solutions that align with emerging global AI regulations. Their work with the UAE's AI government and regulators on the ClimateGPT Model in 2023 showcases their early engagement with practical applications of their technology [12].

The company's focus on hardware-rooted security through partnerships with Intel and NVIDIA represents a significant advancement in AI security. By leveraging Intel's Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) and NVIDIA's Hopper architecture, EQTY Lab can provide cryptographic guarantees at the silicon level, creating a more robust foundation for AI trust than software-only solutions [11].

As enterprises increasingly deploy autonomous AI agents that operate with less direct supervision, EQTY Lab's approach to providing portable credentials and continuous runtime verification addresses a critical gap in the market. Their AI Guardian product, scheduled for general availability in Q3 2025, has the potential to significantly impact how organizations approach AI governance and security [1][9].
