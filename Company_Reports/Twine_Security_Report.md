## 4. Addressing the Cybersecurity Challenge

Identified Problem: Cybersecurity talent gap - an acute shortage of cybersecurity professionals with the experience and skills to manage complex security operations, particularly in identity and access management. According to company materials, 87% of business executives globally claim their companies are not adequately protected against cyber attacks, with this issue exacerbated by the severe talent deficit in cybersecurity. This shortage increases threat exposure risk and forces CISOs to focus on firefighting rather than taking a proactive approach to risk management.

Company Mission: According to their website, Twine's mission is to "create the AI workforce of the future to redefine how cyber teams execute security tasks." The company aims to address the acknowledged talent gap in the cybersecurity industry, focusing not just on people trained in cybersecurity theory, but those with the experience to understand infrastructure and tools with all their intricacies.

Market Size & Opportunity: The cybersecurity workforce gap continues to grow as organizations struggle with increasing security tasks while facing significant talent shortages. Identity and Access Management presents a particularly complex challenge, with IAM projects often subject to delays, cost overruns, and implementation difficulties. Twine estimates that their solution can reduce IAM costs by up to 70% while improving execution quality and consistency.

## 5. Solution Approach

Core Technology & Innovation: Twine Security introduces AI digital employees that go beyond simple automation to execute security tasks from beginning to completion. Their first digital employee, "Alex," specializes in Identity and Access Management (IAM), handling the complete workflow of identity-related tasks autonomously while integrating with existing systems.

Key Features and Functionality Explained: 
1. **End-to-End Execution**: Unlike legacy automation that requires human intervention for complex scenarios, Twine's digital employees can handle entire processes from planning to execution.
2. **Learning & Adaptation**: The AI employees learn organizational environments, processes, and technologies to create tailored solutions for each company's unique needs.
3. **Expertise Library**: Beyond using large language models, Twine's solution incorporates domain-specific expertise in IAM processes.
4. **Enhanced Tool Utilization**: The digital employees optimize existing IAM tools and investments rather than replacing them.
5. **Autonomous Issue Resolution**: AI employees can repair issues, remove roadblocks, and handle edge cases with minimal human intervention.
6. **Trust & Security Architecture**: Implements a separation of duties between AI and execution layers for safety, with compliance to SOC2, GDPR, CCPA, and AWS security best practices.

Scalability & Future Roadmap: While the company's current focus is on IAM with their first digital employee Alex, their platform appears designed to expand to other cybersecurity domains. Their approach of creating specialized AI workers for different security functions suggests a broader vision of addressing multiple security challenges with domain-specific digital employees.

Additional Insights from RSA 2025 Pitch:
- Twine Security's first AI digital employee, Alex, is a SaaS-based, multi-agent system that autonomously executes security tasks, learns and adapts daily, and integrates with business environments.
- Alex has already completed large-scale identity hygiene projects in weeks that would have taken months manually, processing unstructured data and validating actions with stakeholders.
- The platform supports IGA implementation, SOX compliance, and autonomous ticketing, saving hundreds of hours for customers each month.
- Twine's team has a track record of building billion-dollar companies and is backed by top VCs and angels.
- The company is not limited to identity—Alex is only the beginning of their AI digital employee vision.

## 10. Appendix

According to the Forrester report, Twine Security introduced AI digital employees and provided solid metrics on time saved. However, the report noted that questions of accountability, governance, and trust must be addressed more directly for this type of solution [1][3].

The company's core values, as stated on their website, are summarized as "Up, Close & Personal":
- **Up**: Pushing boundaries and redefining possibilities with groundbreaking technology and innovation
- **Close**: Emphasizing collaboration with clients and continuous learning
- **Personal**: Maintaining authentic connections with clients and allowing team members to challenge the status quo with transparency and humility

Twine Security was one of several finalists that analysts characterized as representing "possible features (or products) for platform vendors to snag via acquisition" rather than fully independent companies. While the company demonstrated tangible benefits in terms of time savings through its AI digital employees, concerns remain about how accountability and governance will be maintained when critical security tasks are delegated to AI agents [1][3][4].
