## 4. Addressing the Cybersecurity Challenge

Identified Problem: AI security at inference - As organizations rapidly adopt AI systems, they face critical security challenges at the inference layer where these systems are most vulnerable to attacks. Traditional security approaches don't address the unique risks of AI systems, including prompt injections, jailbreaks, data exfiltration, and compliance violations. Enterprises struggle with three key challenges: 
1. Untested AI models being deployed without proper security evaluation
2. AI systems vulnerable to manipulation and security threats 
3. Lack of visibility into AI usage across the enterprise

Company Mission: According to their website, CalypsoAI's mission is to "secure the future of AI by enabling enterprises to innovate confidently, backed by cutting-edge security and compliance solutions." The company focuses on protecting AI at the inference layer, where it's most vulnerable to attacks.

Market Size & Opportunity: As AI adoption accelerates across enterprises, the market for AI security solutions is growing rapidly. With the proliferation of large language models and generative AI applications in business environments, organizations are increasingly recognizing the need for specialized security controls at the inference layer. CalypsoAI has positioned itself as a leader in this emerging market with its comprehensive platform approach to AI security.

## 5. Solution Approach

Core Technology & Innovation: CalypsoAI has developed the concept of the "Inference Perimeter" - an enterprise-ready security layer that protects AI across all models, vendors, and environments. Their approach tackles problems related to widespread adoption of enterprise AI through a comprehensive platform with three integrated components that work together to secure AI at the inference layer.

Key Features and Functionality Explained:

1. **Proactive Security with Red-Team**: 
   - Leverages automated AI security testing to identify vulnerabilities before deployment
   - Evaluates model security during selection to prevent adoption of unsafe models
   - Tests AI applications throughout the development lifecycle
   - Continuously evolves testing methods to address emerging threats
   - Features an "Agentic Warfare" approach that uses AI to test AI security
   - Provides automated assessments to ensure AI defenses stay ahead of evolving threats
   - Offers efficient collaboration tools for sharing findings across teams [1]

2. **Real-time Protection with Defend**:
   - Stops threats before they reach AI applications
   - Blocks prompt injections, jailbreaks, and data exfiltration attempts
   - Provides adaptive security that evolves with changing threat landscape
   - Ensures AI interactions remain secure without disrupting performance
   - Prevents sensitive data exposure through real-time content scanning
   - Offers centralized enforcement of AI security policies
   - Provides comprehensive threat detection and response capabilities [1]

3. **Comprehensive Visibility with Observe**:
   - Eliminates blind spots by providing enterprise-wide oversight
   - Tracks AI usage and monitors for unauthorized access
   - Enforces compliance with regulations and internal policies
   - Identifies security incidents before they escalate
   - Simplifies compliance by automatically flagging non-compliant AI interactions
   - Provides trend analysis for AI usage, performance, risk, and compliance
   - Integrates with existing security stacks for unified visibility [1]

Differentiation: Unlike traditional security approaches that weren't designed for AI systems, CalypsoAI's platform is purpose-built to address the unique challenges of securing AI at inference. Their "Agentic Warfare" approach uses AI to test and secure AI, providing a more sophisticated and adaptive security solution. The company has also created the CalypsoAI Security Leaderboard, which ranks AI models by their real-world attack resilience, helping organizations make informed decisions about model selection based on security considerations. [1]

Additional Insights from RSA 2025 Pitch:
- CalypsoAI secures the new "agentic" attack surface, protecting organizations as AI agents make business decisions and take actions autonomously.
- The platform supports agentic security at both the "thought" and "action" stages, stopping attacks before actions are taken (e.g., blocking AI-driven phishing at the thought stage).
- CalypsoAI's red teaming uses AI agents to simulate agentic warfare, exposing vulnerabilities pre- and post-production.
- The company has enabled customers to scale to hundreds of thousands of AI interactions per hour and supports both on-prem and cloud deployments.
- The team has deep experience building and scaling category-defining security companies and is leveraging armies of AI agents to scale operations and threat research.

Scalability & Future Roadmap: The platform is designed for enterprise-scale deployment with same-day setup and seamless integration with existing security infrastructures. Their future development appears focused on expanding their threat intelligence capabilities and enhancing their automated security testing to address increasingly sophisticated AI attacks. The company also maintains "The AI Inference Security Project," suggesting ongoing research and development in the field of AI security. [1]

## 6. Customer & Traction

## 10. Appendix

According to the Forrester report, CalypsoAI tackles problems related to the widespread adoption of enterprise AI through its agentic warfare solution, which continuously evaluates the security of AI systems by adapting and refining approaches with agentic AI [3].

CalypsoAI is part of the growing trend of companies focused on both using AI to improve security and securing AI itself. As enterprises increasingly deploy AI solutions, CalypsoAI provides the security tools needed to ensure these systems remain secure against novel and evolving threats. The company's focus on runtime protection with customizable controls helps enterprises safely scale AI deployments while maintaining security and compliance [1][2][4].

The company's evolution is notable, with a recent leadership change in April 2025 when Donnchadh Casey was appointed as CEO to guide the company through its next growth phase. CalypsoAI has shown consistent revenue growth, increasing from $2M in 2021 to approximately $3.8M in 2024, representing a solid trajectory in the emerging AI security market.

CalypsoAI's three-pronged approach to AI security (Red-Team, Defend, and Observe) represents a comprehensive solution to the complex challenge of securing AI at the inference layer. Their focus on this specific security perimeter addresses a critical gap in the market as enterprises rapidly adopt AI technologies without fully understanding or mitigating the associated risks.
