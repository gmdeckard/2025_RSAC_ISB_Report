    - **NeuroLock**: Powers a differentiated threat prevention and data security engine, supporting 500+ topics, themes, and document categories for automatic data discovery and real-time policy enforcement.
    - **NeuroOps**: Provides AI teammates that significantly simplify AI SOC operations.
- The platform includes a natural language-based query interface, enabling any user persona to understand AI utilization and risk across the organization.
- Aurascape's philosophy is "Allow is the new block"â€”the platform is designed to empower users to innovate fearlessly with AI, while providing security teams with the tools to manage risk without being a "sledgehammer."
- As of the RSA 2025 pitch, Aurascape had filed 14 patents and grown to 40+ employees with a world-class engineering team in Silicon Valley.

Technology Stack: 
- AI-native engine
- Real-time monitoring for AI communications
- Protocol-level visibility (including Websocket)
- Multi-layer classification and context analysis 
- Behavior analytics
- Integrated policy enforcement [1][5]

## 4. Addressing the Cybersecurity Challenge

Identified Problem: Organizations face significant challenges securing AI usage, including:
- Widespread and growing adoption of AI tools creating security gaps
- Shadow AI usage (executives underestimate actual AI use by up to 300%)
- Traditional security solutions unable to decipher dynamic AI communications
- Lack of visibility into AI interactions across thousands of applications
- New AI-driven threats specific to these technologies
- Risk of sensitive data and intellectual property exposure through AI tools
- Need to balance security with productivity benefits of AI [1][5][6]

Market Size & Opportunity: With AI adoption rapidly accelerating across enterprises, the market for AI security solutions is growing exponentially. According to Aurascape, one in three employees report paying out-of-pocket for at least one AI app, while over a quarter of organizations report attempting to block AI access entirely. This creates significant tension between security needs and productivity demands, opening a substantial market opportunity for solutions that can enable safe AI adoption [6].

## 5. Solution Approach

Core Technology & Innovation: Aurascape's platform is specifically engineered for AI interactions, with the ability to understand, monitor, and secure AI communications in ways that traditional security tools cannot. The company's approach centers on providing deep visibility into AI prompt-response pairs across all types of AI applications, combined with context-aware protection that minimizes false positives while maintaining security [1][5].

Key Features and Functionality Explained:
- **Complete AI Application Coverage**: The platform offers automated discovery, risk analysis, and insights for thousands of AI, generative AI, and agentic AI applications. It can discover brand-new AI apps as they appear, providing continuous visibility across approved and unknown AI tools [1][5].

- **Multimodal Data Protection**: Aurascape protects sensitive data in all formats it exists (voice, video, text, code, etc.) with AI-native data security specifically designed for AI interactions. The system provides automated labeling and data classification with hundreds of categories, topics, and industry-specific labels [1][5].

- **Threat Prevention**: The platform prevents sophisticated AI-driven threats including phishing, social engineering, malicious code generation, embedded malware in AI responses, and other AI-specific attack vectors. It goes beyond traditional prevention with content-level, human-like understanding of AI interactions [1][5].

- **AI Copilot Readiness**: Aurascape enables safe deployment of AI Copilots by first running a readiness assessment for corporate repositories to discover sensitive files and potential oversharing. It then continuously monitors repositories and Copilot activity to ensure sensitive data is only shared appropriately [1][5].

- **Granular Policy and Remediation**: The platform allows for configuring protection policies that can block entire risky AI apps or only stop actions flagged as dangerous. Policies consider app risk profile, user access, and data sensitivity to minimize disruption while maintaining security. Automated workflows handle remediation so security teams can focus on real incidents [1][5].

Scalability & Future Roadmap: As an AI-native platform designed to handle thousands of AI applications, Aurascape's architecture is built for scalability and adaptability to the evolving AI landscape. The company emphasizes that its platform covers "the newest embedded AI, generative AI and agentic AI apps and tools," suggesting an ongoing focus on expanding coverage as new AI technologies emerge [1][5].

## 10. Appendix

According to the Forrester report, Aurascape was one of two entrants looking to reinvent data loss prevention (DLP). The report noted that Aurascape's message of "innovating fearlessly" didn't match well with the solution, which focused on AI application discovery and DLP-esque use cases [3].

Aurascape is addressing a critical emerging gap in the cybersecurity landscape: the need to secure AI usage across the enterprise. Traditional security approaches were not designed for the unique challenges posed by AI technologies, including their dynamic communication methods, the sensitive nature of prompts and responses, and the potential for new types of threats.

The company's approach recognizes several key realities about AI adoption:

1. **AI Adoption Is Inevitable and Beneficial**: Rather than trying to block AI usage, which creates shadow AI problems, Aurascape aims to enable safe AI adoption by providing visibility and controls.

2. **Traditional Security Is Insufficient**: Existing security tools like firewalls, proxies, and Secure Service Edge (SSE) solutions cannot adequately monitor or secure AI communications.

3. **Balance Between Security and Productivity**: Organizations need to balance protecting sensitive data with allowing employees to benefit from AI productivity gains.

4. **Need for AI-Specific Protections**: New types of threats emerge with AI adoption, requiring new protection approaches specifically designed for AI interactions.

**RSA 2025 Pitch Highlights:**
- Aurascape's CEO emphasized the need for security solutions that adapt to the dynamic, evolving nature of AI tools, which are fundamentally different from traditional software.
- The platform's agentic AI systems (NeuroPlane, NeuroLock, NeuroOps) and natural language query interface were highlighted as key differentiators.
- The company's mission is to enable users to "innovate fearlessly" and empower organizations to embrace AI securely and productively.

Aurascape's founding team brings significant expertise from leading cybersecurity companies, including Zscaler, Palo Alto Networks, Netskope, and Juniper Networks. This experience, combined with substantial funding from respected venture capital firms, positions the company to potentially lead in the emerging AI security market.

The company's selection as an RSA Innovation Sandbox finalist, despite Forrester's critique of its messaging alignment, indicates the industry's recognition of the importance of addressing AI security challenges as organizations increasingly adopt these transformative technologies.
