1. **Copilot Readiness Assessment**: A service that identifies sensitive business content that could be exposed through Enterprise AI search tools before deployment, providing organizations with a safety net for AI adoption. [1][6]

2. **Visibility & Monitoring**: Tools to detect and monitor AI oversharing incidents across enterprise systems, with continuous tracking of user interactions to flag policy violations that could lead to data leakage. [1][6]

3. **Policy Creation and Management**: Framework for defining Need-to-Know policies tailored to an organization's specific security requirements and user roles. [1][6]

4. **Remediation Solutions**: Capabilities to address oversharing at the file level through automated labeling, classification, and permission adjustments. [1][6]

5. **Protection Systems**: Proactive security modules that can be used with AI firewalls to implement discretionary access controls for various LLMs across the organization. [1][6]

Key Features:
- Need-to-know based access controls specifically designed for LLMs
- Alternative information suggestions instead of simple access blocking
- User-friendly approach to information security that enhances rather than limits AI utility
- Knowledge-centric capabilities that focus on securing information at the content level
- Continuous monitoring for policy violations and unauthorized data exposure
- Integration with enterprise AI search tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and Glean
- Multi-layered security approach that identifies, remediates, and protects against AI oversharing

Technology Stack: AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), Access Control Systems, Knowledge Management, Policy Enforcement, Enterprise Search Integration

## 4. Addressing the Cybersecurity Challenge

Identified Problem: AI oversharing - the risk of AI systems revealing sensitive or inappropriate information to users who shouldn't have access to it. This problem is particularly acute with enterprise AI search tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and Glean, which can unintentionally expose confidential business information ranging from M&A due diligence to employee compensation details. [1][6][7]

Key Challenges:

1. **Data Leakage**: LLMs indiscriminately distribute documents and information, accelerating security incidents due to the high usage of search functionality. [1][5]

2. **Inference Issues**: AI systems draw conclusions based on available information and share these insights with no filter for who can access the underlying data. [1][5]

3. **Adoption Slowdown**: Security concerns about data exposure prevent organizations from fully deploying AI tools across their workforces. [1][5][7]

4. **Traditional Security Limitations**: Conventional data protection measures like Microsoft Purview and standard DLP solutions weren't designed for the unique challenges of LLMs and struggle to effectively control AI-powered information access. [1][6]

Market Size & Opportunity: While specific market size figures aren't provided, Knostic operates in the rapidly growing AI security market. As enterprise adoption of AI search tools and LLMs accelerates, the need for specialized security controls becomes critical. Admiral Mike Rogers, former NSA Director and Knostic advisory board member, has emphasized that "LLM oversharing is a huge problem that enterprises really need to pay attention to," highlighting the significance of the market opportunity. [1][7]

## 5. Solution Approach

Core Technology & Innovation: Knostic has developed a sophisticated multi-layered security approach that embeds security at the knowledge layer rather than just at the application or network level. Their technology focuses on "need-to-know" access controls that are specifically tailored for LLMs, ensuring that AI-powered queries return only the information users are authorized to see while maintaining a positive user experience. [1][5][6][7]

Key Features and Functionality Explained:

1. **Need-to-Know Policy Framework**: 
   - Unlike traditional access controls that simply allow or deny access, Knostic's approach reshapes LLM responses to fit a user's business context
   - Contextualizes information delivery rather than just blocking it completely
   - Creates user-specific boundaries for AI interaction based on role and permissions [1][6][7]

2. **Multi-Layered Security Process**:
   - Visibility: Proactively discovers overshared content within existing systems, particularly focusing on Microsoft 365 environments [1][6]
   - Policy Creation and Management: Establishes the basis for defining organizational need-to-know policies [1][6]
   - Remediation: Works at the file level to label and classify sensitive information, enabling automated or manual adjustment of permissions [1][6]
   - Monitoring: Continuously tracks user interactions to flag policy violations that could lead to data leakage [1][6]
   - Protection: Implements proactive security through AI firewalls that accept per-user and per-topic rulesets [1][6]

3. **Copilot Readiness Assessment**:
   - Focuses on identifying and remediating overshared information related to sensitive business topics
   - Conducted from the perspective of individual user profiles or at the department level
   - Takes a broad approach with prompts built on a corpus of sensitive business topics for specific user profiles
   - Can uncover 80% of high-priority findings in less than 20% of the time compared to traditional methods [1][6]

## 10. Appendix

According to the Forrester report, Knostic tackles problems related to the widespread adoption of enterprise AI by addressing AI oversharing through need-to-know principles while providing a superior user experience by suggesting alternative information rather than simply blocking access [3].

Knostic's approach to AI security represents a novel solution in the rapidly evolving landscape of enterprise AI adoption. Their focus on securing AI at the knowledge layer, rather than just at the application or network level, addresses a critical gap in the current security ecosystem. As more organizations deploy AI search tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and Glean, the risk of inadvertent data exposure increases significantly.

The company's need-to-know based access controls differentiate it from traditional security approaches by maintaining the utility of AI while enhancing security. Rather than implementing blunt access restrictions that impede AI functionality, Knostic shapes AI responses to fit each user's authorized context, preserving the value of AI while mitigating risks.

Industry recognition through winning both the RSA Conference Launch Pad and Black Hat Startup Spotlight competitions in 2024 underscores the market's recognition of the problem Knostic is solving. The recent $11 million funding round led by Bright Pixel Capital, with participation from Silicon Valley CISO Investments and other investors, further validates the critical need for solutions that address AI oversharing [1][7][8].

As summarized by Gadi Evron, Knostic's CEO: "PCs had Norton. Networks had Palo Alto Networks and the cloud has Wiz. AI will need Knostic. We put an end to LLM oversharing." [8] This positioning highlights the company's ambition to become the essential security layer for enterprise AI adoption, similar to how other security technologies became fundamental components of previous technology waves.
