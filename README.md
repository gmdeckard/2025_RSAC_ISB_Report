# RSA Innovation Sandbox 2025 Summary Report

## Overview

The 2025 RSA Innovation Sandbox competition marked the 20th anniversary of this prestigious event, showcasing 10 emerging cybersecurity companies competing with 3-minute pitches to a panel of expert judges. Since the contest's inception, finalists have collectively seen over 90 acquisitions and generated more than $16.4 billion in investments as of December 31, 2024 [1].

The 2025 competition saw a remarkable 40% increase in submissions compared to the previous year, with over 200 cybersecurity startups applying from around the world. This growth underscores the contest's growing influence and prestige within the cybersecurity industry [2].

In a significant development for 2025, each finalist received a $5 million uncapped simple agreement for future equity (SAFE) investment provided by Crosspoint Capital Partners (owner of the conference). This uncapped SAFE investment means there is no predetermined limit on how high a company's valuation can be when the SAFE converts into equity at the next funding round [3].

The winners were announced on April 28, 2025, during the RSA Conference held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco [4].

## Winner and Runner-Up

### Winner: ProjectDiscovery

ProjectDiscovery was named "Most Innovative Startup 2025" at RSAC 2025. This open-source vulnerability detection company equips security teams with tools to find and fix vulnerabilities quickly. Powered by Nuclei, their platform automates attack surface monitoring and vulnerability management to help organizations stay ahead of real-world threats [4].

According to Andy Cao, COO of ProjectDiscovery: "Winning the 20th annual RSAC Innovation Sandbox contest is recognition that open source is possible in security. It's a testament to everyone in our community who's contributed to getting us here. It's been a global effort, and we are really proud of everyone involved in getting us to this stage. We are excited to democratize security and make the world a safer place." [4]

In his pitch, Cao highlighted how traditional vulnerability scanning is fundamentally broken: "Security teams are stuck using scanners built 20 years ago, drowning in false positives. We spend 16 billion a year on vulnerability management, but security teams still can't answer what threats are actually exploitable." [5] ProjectDiscovery addresses this problem by focusing on vulnerability prioritization based on exploitability testing, challenging traditional approaches by testing whether vulnerabilities are truly exploitable [3].

### Runner-Up: CalypsoAI

CalypsoAI secured the runner-up position with its Inference Platform, which protects AI applications and agents at runtime. The platform offers customizable defensive controls, agentic red-teaming, remediation, governance, and observability solutions to help enterprises safely scale AI implementations.

During his pitch, CEO Donnchadh Casey framed the problem elegantly: "AI agents are human too, right? If you believe that, you're good, because all of today's security controls are set for human decisions and human actions. But how do you protect your organizations when decisions and actions aren't human?" [6] CalypsoAI's approach involves an "agentic warfare solution" that continuously evaluates AI security by adapting and refining approaches with agentic AI [3].

Metalware's approach has demonstrated a 78% faster identification of firmware vulnerabilities compared to traditional methods and an 85% reduction in false positives [15]. While fuzzing is a common approach in IoT and OT security, Metalware must navigate a crowded supply chain security market to establish its differentiation.

### MIND
Founded in 2023 with offices in Seattle (USA) and Tel Aviv (Israel), MIND offers a data security platform that puts Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Insider Risk Management (IRM) programs on autopilot [17]. During his RSA pitch, CEO Eran Barak shared his experience: "A decade ago, I co-founded Hexadite, a pioneering startup in the SOAR space that was acquired by Microsoft. Looking back, more than half of the alerts the Hexadite platform investigated came from DLP tools, and the majority were false positives... Now, a decade later, my team and I witnessed the same situation with security teams, just at a larger scale." [18]

The MIND Platform combines DLP and IRM capabilities with key features including an AI-driven data classification and categorization engine, autopilot capabilities, sensitive data discovery across diverse IT environments, context-aware risk assessment, automated data security issue remediation, real-time data leak prevention, and comprehensive integrations with SaaS, GenAI, endpoint, and email systems [17].

The company has raised $15 million in seed funding from Greylock Partners and has deployed its solution with early customers reporting an 80% reduction in false positives and 65% less time spent on data security management [17]. MIND's approach of adding automation to insider risk and data loss prevention addresses longstanding pain points in data security management.
